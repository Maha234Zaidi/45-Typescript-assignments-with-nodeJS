//Q20:Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.


//making a list of cities names with the help of array
let citiesNames:string[] = ["Karachi","Quetta","Islamabad","Kohat","Hangu","Hyderabad","Kaghaan","Naraan"];

//print a message
console.log(`List of cities names: \n`);

//useing a forEach function because of print one by one element in the form of list
citiesNames.forEach(cityName => console.log(cityName));
