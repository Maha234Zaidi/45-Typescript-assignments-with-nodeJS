//Q42: Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 41. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

let magicianNames:string[] = ["Joker","Gem","Albert"];

function show_magicians(magicians:string[]){
   magicians.forEach(magician_one => console.log(magician_one));   
}

function make_great(magicians:string[]){
    return magicians.map(magician_one => `The Great ${magician_one}.`
    )
}

let greatMagician = make_great(magicianNames);
show_magicians(greatMagician)
